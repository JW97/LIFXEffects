LIFXEffects
===========

Adds a few cool Lighting Effects to the LIFX App.

Tweaking the various paramters for timings, ramp periods etc throughout the code is recommended to get the effects to suit your own setup.

Effects
=======

Fade - Simply fades through the entire colour spectrum in a pre-defined time period (default is 100 seconds).
Random Colour - Cycles through all the lights assigned to it and pulses a random colour before moving to the next bulb.
